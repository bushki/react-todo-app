JSX is javscript and html combined, used to render react components
    can't use the class attribute, have to use className

    All list items must have keys 
    Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. 
    https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys

In JSX components can have their styling inline
Styles are same as CSS except camelCase instead of hyphens
Ex: backgroundColor instead of background-color
